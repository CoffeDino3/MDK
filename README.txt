🌙 Lunacy — Race Expansion Mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 (Forge)

Lunacy is a race-expansion mod for Minecraft 1.21.1, designed to change the way players experience survival. The mod adds nine unique playable races, each with its own stats, passive effects and a special ability that can be activated through a dedicated keybind. The race you choose at the start of the game will influence how you explore the world, how you fight, and how you survive.

Current Races:
The mod currently includes Sculk, Warder, Ender, Phantom, Lover, Believer, Angelborn, Vampireborn, Ethereal and Celestial. Each race has a distinct playstyle — from teleportation and gliding to block-phasing, damage barriers or gravity control. Some abilities offer mobility, others defense or offensive power, and a few come with risks or limitations that encourage strategic use.

How It Works:
After installing the mod and launching Minecraft, players will be prompted to select a race when entering a world for the first time. Every race comes with permanent attributes and a unique active ability that can be triggered using a configurable keybind in the controls menu. Most features work in both singleplayer and multiplayer without requiring any additional plugins or server-side setup.

Requirements:
Lunacy is built for Minecraft 1.21.1 and requires Forge (52.x.x or compatible). Simply place the mod .jar into the mods folder and start the game.

Future Development:
Planned updates include additional races, expanded systems, new abilities and configurable values for balancing. Feedback from players is welcome and will help shape future releases.
